# Microsoft 365 Pay-as-you-go services pricing with Azure subscription

When you use a Microsoft pay-as-you-go service linked to an Azure subscription, the service gets billed using the Azure subscription that you specified when you set up billing.  

The following table describes the service, its pricing, and how it measures usage. When you connect your Azure subscription to the service you’ve set up for pay-as-you-go billing, users in your organization are able to take advantage of the service right away. Your tenant is billed according to the details shown in the following table:

| Service              | What’s Counted?                                                                 | What’s billed? (USD)       |

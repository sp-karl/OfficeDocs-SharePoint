## Navigation errors

|**Error**|**Reason**|**Action**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|This navigation node contains an invalid URL: cannot find the object this URL points to. |SharePoint Online will validate the URL before it creates the navigation node. If the URL represents a SharePoint object and the object cannot be found. SPO will reject the node creation query with this error. This can happen if the target of the URL was deleted, moved, not migrated yet, migrated in previous task where the URL mapping cannot be recognized in current job.|Use the same URL mapping between multiple tasks. For example:  </br></br> Task 1:  http:<span><span>//domain/original_path/site -> http://<span><span>domain/new_path/site<span><span> </br></br>Task 2: http://<span><span>domain/original_path/site2 -> http://<span><span>domain/new_path/site2<span><span>.  </br></br> Run another task to migrate Navigation nodes pointing to objects that were not migrated previously. Manually created the node in target site.|
|The navigation settings are highly customized. Currently it's not supported. |Global and current site navigation can only be migrated if its value matches a predefined template. Otherwise,the value will be recognized as *highly customized* and won’t get migrated.|Change the global and current navigation to use one of the predefined templates.  See *Site settings -> Look and Feel -> Navigation*. Manually edit the setting on target site.|
|Could not get target Term Store ID. The taxonomy provider of web navigation settings cannot be updated. |As the global and/or current site navigation settings is set to  “Managed Navigation”, the term store scanner was unable to get the target term store ID. This can happen if Managed Metadata Services are not properly configured.|Learn more at [SPMT Managed Metadata Migration](managed-metadata-migration.md).|
|The taxonomy provider term set ID of web navigation settings is invalid. |As the global and/or current site navigation settings is set to “Managed Navigation”, the term store scanner was unable to map the term set ID. |Confirm that the setting on the source site is valid and the term set was successfully migrated.|
|To update web navigation settings, you need following permissions: Add and Customize Pages.|The SPO account used for migration doesn’t have permission to edit site navigation settings.|Grant “Add and Customize Pages” permission to this account. |

## Taxonomy errors
|**Error**|**Reason**|**Action**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Migrate term store failed due to permission issue. |Current user is not a term store admin. |In the SharePoint Admin Center, select *Classic features*, and then under *Term store* click **Open**. Select the term store you want to migrate, then add the current user as a Term Store admininistrator.|
|Migrate term store failed due to lack of working languages. |Not all working languages of source term store exist in the target term store. |Go to SharePoint Online site setting. Under Site Administration, click Term store management. Choose the term store you want to update, select and add all the languages existing in source term store to the target working language panel.|
|Migrate term store failed due to default term store does not exist. |There is no default site collection term store at SP on-prem. |Go to SharePoint Server (on-premises) Central Administration, manage service application under Application Management, edit the properties of Managed Metadata Service Connection. Select the **This service application is the default storage location for column specific term sets**.|
|Migrate term store failed due to several default term stores exist. |There are several default site collection term stores existing at SP on-prem. |Go to SharePoint OnPrem Central Administration, manage service application under Application Management, choose one Managed Metadata Service Connection as default term store. Deselect **This service application is the default storage location for column specific term sets** of other Managed Metadata Service Connections.|
|Migrate pinned term failed due to its source term does not exist. |In some cases, the pinned term is in global term set (available for all sites connecting to this Managed Metadata Service Application), and the source term is in local term set (available for users of this site collection). Because SPMT will migrate the global terms first, then migrate the local ones, when trying to create the pinned term,  the source term has not been migrated yet.|Migrate again, and the pinned term will be created for the second time,  as the source term has been migrated before.|


## Web part errors
|**Error**|**Reason**|**Action**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Migration not supported web part | Currently, SPMT does not support this web part.| Check the list of currently supported web parts:  [SPMT supported web parts](spmt-supported-webparts.md) |
|Migration failed due to referring list is missing |The list has not been added to the task list. |Check your web part and the referring list to ensure it is in your migration scope.|
|Migration failed due to page being customized | SPMT currently does not support customized page migration. |Restore the page’s template page by using SharePoint Designer and restart your migration.|
|Migration failed due to page migration failed |Migration of the page failed, and all the web parts on that page.| Retry migrating the failed page. If the page succeeds, then all the web parts on that page will successfully migrate.|
|Migration failed due to it is an unsafe web part and the server setting ‘NoScript’| When the setting **NoScript** is turned on in the target SharePoint Online site, the web parts are considered to be unsafe as they could have the ability to execute JavaScript scripts or other code. Web parts will be blocked from migrating. |Turn off the  **NoScript** setting on the target SharePoint Online site so that these web parts will be unblocked. Important: Your site may be at risk if you turn off the settings. See this link for more info. |
| Migration failed due to invalid XML definition |The XsltListView web part and ListView web part contain an XML definition which is critical for the migration of these web parts.  Sometimes the XML definition is invalid due to upgrading issues or server errors.|Delete the failed web part from the SharePoint Server  source page.  Re-add it and try the migration again.|
| Migration failed due to invalid assembly name |The assembly name of the web part is critical for SPMT to migrate the web part. If the assembly of the web part cannot be parsed from its SOAP response the migration fails. |Check whether this web part is a supported “out-of-the box” (OOTB) web part. If it is supported, please file a bug and we will investigate.  However, if is a 3rd party web part, it is not supported. |
|Migration failed due to web part connection failure. |The web part is connected to another web part that failed to migrate, causing both to fail. |Make sure the connected web part is migrated successfully. Re-try your migration.|
|Migration failed due to unable to map user |If User field is a property of the web part, SPMT will attempt to map the user on the source web part (usually an on-premises user) to a user on the target SharePoint Online site. This error occurs when SPMT cannot map to the user. |Confirm that Azure Active Directory is used to sync all on-premises users to SharePoint Online. See this link for more info.|
